## Background

Software development is a very *creative* profession. It's a pure logical art! But the main difference with other types of art is that you must *not* be selfish. Your code must run well for the user and be readable for another contributors of the project.

Here in this documentation we are going to write about some tips and good practices that you should follow in order to contribute in Geeks projects (or your own projects as an advanced code practice; Almost like a big `CONTRIBUTING.md` guideline).
