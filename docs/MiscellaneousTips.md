## Variable Declarations

&nbsp;&nbsp; Variables should be declared as close to their usage as possible. Instead of defining all variables at the beginning of a method, define each right where you want to use them.
Control variables for loops should usually be declared within the loop statement. In general, if a variable is only used inside a block with { and } then declare the variable inside the block to limit its scope.
