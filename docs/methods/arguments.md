# How many arguments?

- The ideal number of arguments for a method is zero.
- Next comes one, followed closely by two.
- Three arguments should be avoided where possible.
- More than three requires very special justification—and then shouldn’t be used anyway.

> **A large number of arguments in a method is usually a code smell, that something is missing.** 


## Argument Objects

When a method seems to need multiple arguments, it is likely that all or some of those arguments ought to be wrapped into a class of their own.

Often you realise that the grouping of those argument represents an abstraction, a concept, a missing class in your application. Try hard to **come up with a class name that represents that grouping.** If you succeeded, then do create the class and change the original method to take a single instance of that instead of multiple arguments.

### Example
Consider, for example, the difference between the two following declarations:

```c#
Circle MakeCircle(double x, double y, double radius)
{
   ...
}
```

```c# 
Circle MakeCircle(Point center, double radius)
{
   ...
}
...
class Point
{
    public double X {get; set;}
    public double Y {get; set;}
}
```

## Discovering missing abstractions
When groups of variables are passed together, the way x and y are in the example above, they are likely part of a concept that deserves a name of its own. 

You might be surprised that sometimes when you do that, you may realise that the original method can actually be moved to that class for a cleaner design. 

In particular, if the method was large and doing a lot, you will see that in the context of the new class it can be nicely broken down into several methods with lower abstraction levels.


## Params Array Arguments

Sometimes we want to pass a varying number of arguments into a method. Consider, for example, the String.format method:

```c#
string.Format("{0} worked {1:F2} hours.", name, hours);
```

If the variable arguments are all treated identically, as they are in the example above, then they are equivalent to a single argument of type Array. Such array method arguments are decorated as params in C#.
